It is the regularly organized governing organization of the NONPARTISAN party as reported by the Delaware Commissioner of Elections.</li>
    <li>It may also be referred to as “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/NonPartisanDE">NonPartisanDE</a>”, "<a href="https://www.NonPartisanDE.org">NonPartisanDE.org</a>", or "<a href="https://twitter.com/NonPartisanDE">@NonPartisanDE</a>".</li>
    <li>Non-Partisan Delaware shall be established as an unincorporated association governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, as well as these bylaws.</li>
    <li>The Governing Board established in §4 may, by a 4/5ths vote, alter the corporate structure of Non-Partisan Delaware.  Any such restructuring must be reversible.</li>
    <li>Non-Partisan Delaware shall be registered as a political committee with the Delaware Commissioner of Elections, <a href="https://cfrs.elections.delaware.gov/">CFID: 03004601</a>.  The acting Treasurer shall maintain this committee and ensure the timely submission of all required reports.</li>
    <li>If the Commissioner of Elections unilaterally amends the established committee’s Statement of Organization, the acting Treasurer shall create a new committee whose name and CFID will automatically override the one listed in §1.a & §1.d.</li>

  <h2><li>PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORITY</li></h2>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>These Bylaws as interpreted by the Governing Board established in §4 shall be the final parliamentary authority regarding NPP operations except as prohibited by law.</li>
    <li>Other sources of parliamentary authority may be offered as persuasive authority in situations where these Bylaws are silent, but the will of the majority shall be controlling.</li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Such rulings and appeals shall be publicly cataloged and carry the full force and effect of these Bylaws unless and until they are overturned by amending these Bylaws to render them moot or by following the process outlined in §2.c.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Where these Bylaws or previously rendered rulings are explicit according to a ruling of the acting Chair, a 2/3rds vote will be required on two separate motions to appeal and overturn the chair’s ruling no less than 14 days and no more than 90 days apart.</li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>The first vote to amend these bylaws shall be considered provisionally overturning the ruling of the chair, where failing the second vote may effectively rescind overturning the initial ruling and uphold the ruling retroactively if possible.</li>
      <li>Failure to pass a second motion within 90 days of the first shall rescind the ruling.</li>
      <li>Passing a second motion less than 14 days after the first shall be null and void.</li>
      <li>Votes under this process which have been cast by the membership, in the proper forum, may be ratified by the Governing Board, and vice versa.</li>
      <li>These rulings and appeals shall be <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/non-partisan-delaware-public-record">publicly cataloged</a> and carry the full force and effect of these Bylaws unless and until they are overturned by amending these Bylaws to render them moot or by following the process outlined in this section.</li>

The vote may be called immediately upon request by 2/3rds of the Board.</li>
